    <p>
      This resume scorer compares your resume to either a job description of a job you 
      are applying for or certain key words with assigned weightages. After this comparison, we 
      give you a score out of 100.

    <h1 class = "question">Why is it important?</h1>
    <p>
      Since the coronavirus pandemic started, the unemployment rate stands at a staggering
      14.7%, or 40 million Americans. During these unfortunate times, it is even more difficult to 
      find a job. Unfortunately, current ATS (applicant tracking system) software is inaccurate and not 
      comprehensive, leading to adept candidates getting overlooked. 
      Additionally, current ATS software is not available to the public for free.
      We want to help jobseekers find jobs, which is made easier through our free resume scorer.

    <h2>Resume Comparison (With Keywords)</h2>
    <p>
       This compares your resume to keywords provided and their corresponding weightages. Enter your resume,
      then certain keywords with weights. Seperate the keywords with commas. For example, a sample input is "java 0.3, computer 0.2".
      The program will output whether or not the resume matches the keywords and weights, depending on if it passes a certain threshold.
