  During these unfortunate events, thousands have lost their lives. According to the New York Times, at least 300,000 people have died and over five million people have been infected. Moreover, over 30 million people have lost their jobs just in the United States. As a result, homelessness and poverty rates have increased dramatically, inducing an even higher wealth inequality. Team 1729x wanted to do something about this. To tackle this problem, over the past day, we brainstormed ideas and finalized and implimented one. 
  
  Introducing the resumeScorer, an online program where users can input their resume and get an output of the amount their resume matches the job description by comparing keywords associated with the job and your resume. Your resume is also scored on a 0-100% basis. 

  It's important to do something to help those who have suffered as a result of this crisis, and this is what we've done to start helping those in need during this pandemic.

  Team 1729x out.
