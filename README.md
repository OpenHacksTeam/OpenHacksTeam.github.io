# OpenHacks Hackathon: resumeScorer
  
  During these unfortunate events, thousands have lost their lives. According to the New York Times, at least 300,000 have died and over five million people have been infected. But, over 30 million have lost their jobs just in the United States. As a result, homelessness and poverty rates have increased dramatically, inducing an even higher wealth inequality. Team 1729x wanted to do something about this. So, over the past 2 days, the team went into brainstorming ideas and finalized one. 
  
  Introducing the resumeScorer, an online program where users can input their resume and output the proficiency of one's resume by comparing keywords associated with the job and your resume. Your resume is also scored on a 0-100% basis. 

  It's important to do something to the people who have suffered as a result of this crisis. And, this is the least that can be done. 

  Team 1729x out.
