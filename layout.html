      This is a platform that checks how thought-out your resume is. The
      program checks for word choice specifically and compares your resume to
      more ideal examples of a very good resume and ranks your resume out of
      100. Ideally, giving you some feedback which you can work on.
    </p>
    <h1 class = "question">What is your motive</h1>
    <p>
      That's a nice question. During these unfortunate times, millions of people
      have lost their jobs and, we wanted to make a program that can help them.
      Sure, this may not seem like a lot, but, we just wanted to do our best.

    <h1 class = "question">Cool, how much does it cost?</h1>
    <p>It's absolutely free, you don't need to pay a single dime.</p>
